    # This is just a demo, but instead of runs-on, and steps above:
    # A COMPANY could standardise a complex process in a reusable workflow as follows:

    # uses: COMPANY/cp-templates/.github/workflows/nodejs-runtime-build.yml@master
    # secrets: inherit
    # with:
    #   node_version: "20"

    # The reusable workflow could do many things such as 🔖generate a build tag,
    # 🏎️ restore node modules cache ⬇️ install dependencies, 😍 check code formatting,
    # 🕵️ run linting, ✅ run tests, 📁 archive code coverage artefacts, 🛠 compile typescript,
    # 🚀 create release, 📂 archive build artifact, 📁 package release artifacts, ⬆️ upload release asset
